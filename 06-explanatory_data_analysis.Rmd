# Explanatory Data Analysis
## Introduction to EDA
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a critical process in the data analysis workflow. It involves examining and visualizing a dataset to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. EDA provides a solid understanding of the data and lays the foundation for more advanced statistical analyses or machine learning models.

The key objectives of EDA are;- 

1. Understand and familiarize the data structure.
2. Detect outliers and anomalies.
3. Identify patterns and trends. 
4. Check and verify assumptions, etc. 

By performing EDA thoroughly, the groundwork is laid for more accurate results, ultimately provides insights that lead to better decision-making. EDA also guides to better model-selection. 

Here are the common techniques involved in EDA;- 

- **Summary Statistics**: The analysts compute the summary statistics like mean, median, mode and standard deviation to find the spread and central tendency in the data. 
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs are drawn to provide a visual interpretation of the data set. 
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Data manipulation and pre-processing is done to reduce the risk of misinterpretation.

There are more EDA techniques like univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis, and inferential statistics.
