### Introduction to Descriptive Statistics

- **Mean, Median and Mode**  

**Mean** is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in the set. It also referred to as average. 
<br> 
**Median** is the middle value when values in a data set is ordered/lined up in ascending/descending order. 
<br>
**Mode** is the number that occurs most in the data set. Simply, the most frequent value in the data set. 

All these, are measures of central tendency. Central tendency identifies the center or typical value of a data set. Measuring central tendency summarizes the data by identifying skewness, distribution and how the data is robust to outliers. Business calculate the central tendencies like average sales, median customer age to make informed decision-making. 


Below is the formula to calculate mean. 

![](images/mean_formula.png)

where *xi* represents each value in the data set, and *n* is the number of values. Lets calculate mean of the vector `ages` with the values `12, 58, 27, 33, 31, 27, 37` manually with the steps below;
```
# Add the values together
total_age = 12 + 58 + 27 + 33 + 31 + 27 + 37
total_age # is 225

number_of_values = 7 # there are 7 values 

mean age = total_age/number_of_values
mean_age # is 32.14
```

The average age is 32.14. 

To calculate the median of the vector `ages`, the ages are arranged in descending/ascending order and the middle one is selected. In this case we will line them up in ascending order 

```
# Line the ages up in ascending order 
12, 27, 27, 31, 33, 37, 58

# There are 7 ages, the fourth one from either side is the median value
# The median age is 31
```

To find mode, you just find the value that appears the most, for the values `12, 27, 27 , 31, 33, 37, 58`, age 27 appears twice while these other ages appear once. The value 27 is therefore the mode. 

Mean, median and mode can also be calculated using Base R using the functions `mean()`, `median()` and `mode()` where the vector ages is the argument. 
```{r}
# Create vector ages
ages = c(12, 58, 27, 33, 31, 27, 37)
# Average/mean
mean(ages)

# Median
median(ages)

# Mode
mode(ages)
```

- **Variance and Standard deviation**

Variance is statistical measure of dispersion that defines how spread the data points are in a data set in relation to the mean of the data set. Standard deviation is the measure of how data is clustered around the mean. It is simply defined to as the square root of variance. 

Variance and standard deviation can be calculated in R environment using `var()` and `sd()` functions respectively. 

Lets create a vector of weights of the athletes in kilograms and calculate the variance and standard deviation.

```{r}
# Sample vector 
athlete_weights = c(55, 76, 52, 68, 71, 63, 58, 52, 85, 96)

# Calculate variance
var(athlete_weights)

# Calculate standard deviation
sd(athlete_weights)
```

- **Range and Interquartile Range**

**Range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data set. This defines the spread and dispersion of a data set. 

Below is the formula for Range:

**Range** *=* **Maximum Value** *-* **Minimum Value**

Lets use the weights vector above to calculate the range;

`weights` = `55, 76, 52, 68, 71, 63, 58, 52, 85, 96`

`maximum_weight` = `96`

`minimum_weight` = `52`

`Range = maximum_weight - minimum_weight = 44`

Range is essential in data analysis as it gives a quick sense of variability in the data set, however it vulnerable to outliers since it gives importance to the maximum and minimum values even if they are extreme. 

**Interquartile Range(IQR)** is the difference between the first quartile (Q1) and third quartile(Q3) value. First Quartile is the median of the lower half of the data while Thrid quartile is the median of the upper of the data set. Therefore 

**IQR** *=* **Q3** *-* **Q1**

Lets calculate the IQR of the vector weights step by step;- 

i. Define the data weights and arrange the data in ascending order. 
`weights = 52, 52, 55, 58, 63, 68, 71, 76, 85, 96`. 
ii. Determine the first quartile (Q1). Select the lower half(first five values) of the data and find their median which is the first quartile (Q1)

`lower_half = 52, 52, 55, 58, 63`

`Q1 = 55`

iii. Determine the third quartile (Q3). Select the upper half(last five values) and find their median which is the third quartile. 

`upper_half = 68, 71, 76, 85, 96`

`Q3 = 76`

iv. Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) by finding the difference between Q1 and Q3. 

`IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 76 - 55 = 21`

The IQR for the weights data set is 21. 


Range and IQR can be calculated in R environment using the `range()` and `IQR()` function respectively. However function range returns the maximum and the minmum values in the dataset. 

```{r}
# Sample vector 
athlete_weights = c(55, 76, 52, 68, 71, 63, 58, 52, 85, 96)
                    
# RANGE 
range(athlete_weights) # returns maximum and minimum values
diff(range(athlete_weights)) # calculate the range value

# INTER QUARTILE RANGE (IQR)http://127.0.0.1:38237/rmd_output/1/basic-data-types-and-structures.html
IQR(athlete_weights)
```

## Correlation and Regression Analysis
### Introduction to Correlation 
- **Pearson and Spearman Correlation**

Correlation is the relationship between two variables. It can also defined to as the statistic measure to the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. 

There are two types of correlation in statistics;- pearson and spearman correlations. They differ in their calculation methods, assumptions and type of relationships they are suited for. 

Pearson correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables with the assumptions that there is a linear relationship between the variables and the data is normally distributed. Contrarily, Spearman correlation measures the monotonic relationship(whether there is a consistent positive or negative change ) between two variables. The data to be analyzed, don't need to be normally distributed, it can be ordinal with the variables having a non-linear relationship. 

Lets take two variables, `X` and `Y`, Pearson correlation is calculated by dividing the covariance of `X` and `Y` with their product of standard deviation. Below is its formula;

![](images/pearson_formula.png)

`r` is the pearson correlation and it can range from -1 to +1. 

Spearman correlation is calculated by ranking data points, then applying Pearson correlation formula. Below is the formula of spearman correlation;

![](images/spearman_formula.png)

where; 

  * `d` is the difference between the ranks of corresponding variables
  * `n` is the number of observations
  * `r` is the pearson correlation
  
Spearman correlation is insensitive with outliers because it uses ranks other than outliers.
